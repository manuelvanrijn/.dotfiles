## Basic Structure

```yaml
name: Workflow Name          # Optional: Display name in Actions UI
run-name: Custom Run Name    # Optional: Custom name for workflow runs

on: [push, pull_request]     # Triggers

permissions:                 # Optional: GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
  contents: read

env:                        # Optional: Global environment variables
  NODE_VERSION: '20'

jobs:
  job-id:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Hello World"
```

## Workflow Triggers (`on`)

### Single event
```yaml
on: push
```

### Multiple events
```yaml
on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]
```

### Event with configuration
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/**'
    tags:
      - v1.*
    paths:
      - '**.js'
      - 'src/**'
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'

  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened

  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - development
          - staging
          - production

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday at midnight

  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      config-path:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      token:
        required: true
```

### Common trigger types
- `push`: Code pushed to repository
- `pull_request`: PR opened, synchronized, reopened (runs in PR's base branch context)
- `pull_request_target`: Like pull_request but runs in base repository context with secrets (DANGEROUS with untrusted code)
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger from Actions UI
- `workflow_call`: Called by another workflow (reusable workflows)
- `schedule`: Cron-based scheduling
- `release`: Release published, created, edited, etc.
- `issues`: Issue opened, edited, closed, etc.
- `issue_comment`: Comment on issue or PR

## Permissions

### Default (read-only recommended)
```yaml
permissions: read-all  # or 'write-all' (not recommended)
```

### Granular permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Repository contents
  pull-requests: write  # PR comments, labels, reviews
  issues: write         # Issue comments, labels
  packages: write       # GitHub Packages
  deployments: write    # Deployments
  id-token: write       # OIDC token for cloud auth
```

### Job-level permissions (override workflow-level)
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      contents: write
      deployments: write
```

## Environment Variables

### Workflow-level
```yaml
env:

  NODE_VERSION: '20'
```

### Job-level
```yaml

          - os: ubuntu-latest
            node-version: 20
            experimental: true
        exclude:
          - os: macos-latest
            node-version: 18
      fail-fast: false  # Continue other jobs if one fails

## Path Filtering

```yaml

      - '**.md'            # Markdown files
```

## Branch Filtering

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/**'     # Glob patterns
      - '!releases/alpha' # Exclude pattern
```
